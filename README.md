# temperature_anomaly_time_series
This is a project for the class STA137 Applied Time Series Analysis.
We try to forecast using two different methods:
1.) ARIMA Modeling or First Differencing
2.) Modeling trend and estimating the rough
Our end goal of this project is to compare which method is better for forecasting.
